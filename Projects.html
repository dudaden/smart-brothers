     <h2>Property Refurbishments</h2>
     <p>From day one, you are allocated your own project manager who will act as your single point of contact 
        throughout the project. Coordinating different trades people to make sure your project stays on schedule 
        can be a stressful experience. Your project manager takes away this stress and takes control of the schedule. <br>
        Some projects require the use of external specialist trades people, when this is the case we have a network of 
        trusted sub-contractors that we can provide. The project manager will liaise with any sub-contractors and arrange 
        for them to be on-site when and where they are needed. This means you donâ€™t have to, and ensures that the project 
        runs smoothly.</p>
